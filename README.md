There are three Python files containing a Data Cleaning Class, a Data Extractor Class and a DataBase Connector Class
Then there are 5 Python files that use an example of these classes to setup 5 different tables in a SalesData database which can be accessed using pgadmin4.
These tables are orders_table.sql, dim_users.py, dim_store.py, dim_products.py, dim_card_details.py.
Then there are 5 SQL queries detailing the necessary adjustments, for each table setup in the milestones. 
These tables are orders_table.sql, dim_users.sql, dim_store.sql, dim_products.sql, dim_card_details.sql.
There are also two yaml files localdb_cred.yaml and db_cred.dbl one for the credentials to access the database information and one to upload it to a local database.
Finally there are 9 data_query sql files that perform each task described in the Milestone 4: Querying the Data
